# üí´ About Me:
Hi! I'm Carlos üëã<br>
I basically live between data and code. I started as a dev because I liked to make little things that worked, but I fell madly in love with data when I discovered that I could make computers make intelligent decisions.<br><br>
I'm currently a Data Engineer at Rappi (yes, that app that brings everything to your home! but in the fintech world) and I have a great time optimizing pipelines and making data flow as it should. I love it when I can make something that used to take hours now take minutes... that feeling is priceless üöÄ<br><br>
When I'm not wrangling with Kafka or Spark, I'm probably:<br>
- Exploring new ways to torture data until it confesses its secrets üìä<br>
- Watching tutorials on things that "someday I'm going to use" (spoiler: I never use them) üòÖ<br>
- Trying to convince someone why Python > everything else<br>
- Thinking about my next personal project that I'm definitely going to finish... this time... seriously<br><br>
**Fun fact:** I have more cloud certifications than sense to use them all ‚òÅÔ∏è<br><br>
A collaboration? A data talk? Cool tool recommendations? Write me! I'm always available to talk about tech, data, or why Scala sometimes makes me want to throw my computer out the window ü§ù
